Image reconstruction on the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale handwritten numbers), using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implemented in High-Level-Synthesis (HLS).

The goal of this project is to compare the Software and Hardware implementations on an SDSoC regarding the performance, resources allocation and accuracy. For that purpose, different techniques and optimization methods were used on the hardware implementation such as pipelining, loop unrolling, parallelism, memory segmentation and variable precision datatypes for the pixel representation.
